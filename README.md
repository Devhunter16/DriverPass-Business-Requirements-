# DriverPass Analysis and Design
My client, DriverPass, requested a new system in order to streamline business interactions with their customer base of driving students.

I, as a system analyst, was responsible for analyzing DriverPass system requirements, designing the new system, and presenting my design to the owner. 

I am most proud of my work on requirement gathering and using those requirements to read between the lines to figure out what the client really needed in their new system. I believe my student login UML activity diagram represents this well. 

I believe I could have had more actors and functions in my UML use case diagram. An incomplete UML use case diagram can effect the work of system developers further down the line.

I approach designing software by gathering what requirements I'll need and planning by using psuedocode prior to beginning any actual coding. Creating UML class diagrams may be a good step to take in the future and can help to reduce wasting time re-writing code.
